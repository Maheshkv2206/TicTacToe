Tic-Tac-Toe:- A Classic Game Overview
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple and widely popular game that is often played for fun and mental exercise. 

1.Game Description
  * Players: Two players compete against each other.
  * Objective: The goal is to be the first to align three of your symbols (either X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal on a 3x3 grid.
  * Outcome:
    *  Win: A player wins if they manage to place three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
    *  Draw: The game ends in a tie if all nine cells are filled and neither player has three symbols aligned.

2.How to Play
  * The game board consists of a 3x3 grid, initially empty.
  * Players take turns marking one empty cell on the grid with their symbol (X or O).
  *  The first player to align three of their symbols in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins.
  *  If no alignment is achieved and all cells are filled, the game ends in a draw.

3.Features
  *  Simplicity: Easy to set up and play, requiring only paper and pen or a digital equivalent.
  *  Strategic Depth: Despite its simplicity, the game involves strategic thinking and planning, especially when competing with experienced players.
  *  Universal Appeal: Played across cultures and age groups due to its straightforward rules.

4.Game Variants
  * 4x4 or Larger Grids: Expanding the grid increases the complexity of the game.
  * 3D Tic-Tac-Toe: Played on multiple stacked grids, adding another dimension to the strategy.
  * Timed Versions: Players must make their moves within a set time.

5.Applications
  * Entertainment: A quick and enjoyable way to pass the time.
  * Education: Helps develop logical thinking, pattern recognition, and strategic planning.
  * Programming Exercises: Commonly used as a beginner project in software development to teach algorithms, game logic, and AI.

6.Technologies Used:-
  1.Core Java:
    * Utilizes basic Java programming concepts, including classes, methods, loops, and conditionals.
    * Handles user input using the Scanner class.
  2.OOP Concepts:
    * Encapsulation: The game logic and data are structured in classes and methods.
    * Polymorphism: Could be applied if extending functionality for different game modes.
  3.2D Arrays:
    *  The game board is typically represented as a 2D array for easy manipulation and checking of win conditions.
  4.Java Swing/JavaFX (Optional):
    *  For graphical versions of Tic-Tac-Toe, Java Swing or JavaFX is used to create an interactive GUI.
